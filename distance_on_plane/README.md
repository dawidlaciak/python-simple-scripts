Plane Distance is Python script designed to simulate the movement of a plane from a base position (0, 0) to multiple points on a 2D plane. The script calculates whether the plane can complete the journeys based on the given number of available moves (fuel or steps). The movements are calculated using Manhattan distance, and the script provides step-by-step feedback on the journeys.
