# Binary Tree Decoder

This Python script implements a binary tree structure to encode and decode hierarchical instructions. Each node in the tree represents a piece of text, and traversal through the tree based on a sequence of instructions decodes a meaningful sentence.

## Features

1. **Binary Tree Representation**:

   - Each node contains a text value and references to a left and right child node.

2. **Decoding**:

   - Based on a sequence of instructions (`L` for left, `R` for right), the script traverses the tree and constructs a sentence by concatenating the text from visited nodes.

3. **Customizable**:
   - The tree structure and node values can be modified to represent different sets of hierarchical instructions.
