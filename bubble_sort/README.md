# Bubble Sort and Median Calculator

This Python script provides two main functionalities:

1. **Bubble Sort**: Implements the bubble sort algorithm to sort a list of numbers in ascending order.
2. **Median Calculation**: Calculates the median of a sorted list of numbers.

These two functions are designed to work together: the input list is first sorted using the bubble sort algorithm, and then the median is calculated from the sorted list.

## Features

1. **Bubble Sort**:

   - Sorts a list of numbers in ascending order.
   - Uses a simple and intuitive nested loop approach.

2. **Median Calculation**:
   - Computes the median of a sorted list.
   - Handles both odd and even-length lists.
