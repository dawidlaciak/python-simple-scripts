# Koch Snowfalke

This project generates a **Koch Snowflake Fractal** using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics library. A fractal is a complex geometric figure created through recursive subdivision of a line into smaller segments, forming intricate zigzagging patterns.

## Features

1. Recursive Fractal Drawing - uses recursion to divide each line into smaller segments, creating intricate and beautiful fractal patterns.
2. Customizable Fractal Complexity - the level parameter allows you to control the level of detail. Higher levels generate more detailed and complex fractals.
3. Dynamic Visualization - the drawing process is animated in real-time using Python's turtle graphics library, making it visually engaging.
4. Adjustable Fractal Size - the length parameter lets you scale the size of the Koch Snowflake to fit your desired display.
