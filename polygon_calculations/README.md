This script provides several geometric calculations related to a regular polygon. The following functions are implemented:

- `polygon_diagonals` - calculating the number of diagonals in the polygon.
- `polygon_interior_angles_sum` - calculating the sum of the interior angles of the polygon.
- `polygon_interior_angle` - calculating the interior angle of a regular polygon.
- `circumscribed_circle_radius` - calculating the radius of the circumscribed circle (circle outside the polygon).
- `inscribed_circle_radius` - calculating the radius of the inscribed circle (circle inside the polygon).
- `area_of_polygon` - calculating the area of the polygon.

The functions take two arguments - the number of sides of the polygon (`polygon_sides`) and the length of the side of the polygon (`side_length`).

Function `polygon_all_data(polygon_sides, side_length)` calls all the above functions and prints the results for a given polygon with a specified number of sides and side length.
